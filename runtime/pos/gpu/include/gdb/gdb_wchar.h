/* We handle three different modes here.
   
   Capable systems have the full suite: wchar_t support and iconv
   (perhaps via GNU libiconv).  On these machines, full functionality
   is available.  Note that full functionality is dependent on us
   being able to convert from an arbitrary encoding to wchar_t.  In
   practice this means we look for __STDC_ISO_10646__ (where we know
   the name of the wchar_t encoding) or GNU libiconv, where we can use
   "wchar_t".
   
   DJGPP is known to have libiconv but not wchar_t support.  On
   systems like this, we use the narrow character functions.  The full
   functionality is available to the user, but many characters (those
   outside the narrow range) will be displayed as escapes.
   
   Finally, some systems do not have iconv, or are really broken
   (e.g., Solaris, which almost has all of this working, but where
   just enough is broken to make it too hard to use).  Here we provide
   a phony iconv which only handles a single character set, and we
   provide wrappers for the wchar_t functionality we use.  */
